# RudimentarySimon

This is a simple form of the game Simon using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Idea is from Angela Yu's course for Webdevelopment: 
https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/
After pressing the heading, the game will start and will show you buttons in a particular order with increasing difficulty.
You have to reproduce the order correct to get to the next level.
